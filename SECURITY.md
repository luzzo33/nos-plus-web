# Security Policy

NOS.plus Alpha is a community project. Security feedback is welcome and helps keep the experiment healthy for everyone.

## Reporting

- Email: `support@nos.plus`
- X/Twitter: [@nos_plus](https://x.com/nos_plus) — direct messages are open

Include the affected area, what you tried, and any proof of concept. Screenshots or curl snippets are enough; avoid sharing private data.

## Testing Guidelines

- Use personal or throwaway accounts; leave other users' content alone.
- Keep traffic light. High-volume scans or brute-force tests should be coordinated first.
- If a boundary feels unclear, pause and ask at `support@nos.plus`.

Accidental side effects can happen—just mention them in the report so they can be cleaned up quickly.

## Disclosure

Please hold off on public write-ups until a fix is shipped or we agree otherwise. Credit is happily shared with researchers who want it.
