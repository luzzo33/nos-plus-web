This folder contains legacy or experimental code that ships with the project for historical reference. None of the code in here is built or deployed with the public Next.js application.

- `monitor/` preserves earlier iterations of the trading monitor UI.
- `unused/` holds components and utilities kept for inspiration or future reuse.
- `backend/` contains backend experiments that depended on private infrastructure and should not be used in production.
