# Legacy Express Service

These files represent the original Express.js auth and usage tracking endpoints that powered early private deployments of NOS+. They rely on internal helpers (for example `helpers/turnstile`, `config/db`, and other shared packages) that are not part of this public repository.

If you need similar functionality, treat this code as a starting point and re-implement the missing dependencies in your own private environment.
